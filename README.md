## Description

This sample application demonstrates how to use a GitHub Action to run Playwright tests against a simple Node.js Express.js application that logs in with FusionAuth.

It's part of the article available at: https://fusionauth.io/docs/get-started/run-in-the-cloud/github-actions.

## Run the app

To run this application you will need Node.js and Docker installed. In a terminal run the code below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ritza-co/fusionauth_github_actions.git
docker compose up
```

In another terminal run the code below.

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run start
```

Browse to the app at http://localhost:3000 and log in with `admin@example.com` and `password`.

In another terminal test the app.

```shell
cd app
npx playwright install-deps
npx playwright install
npx playwright test --project=chromium;
# npx playwright test --project=chromium --ui; # to watch the test and see where it fails
```

## Run the tests in a GitHub action

To run these tests in a GitHub action, fork this repository, change the branch in `.github/workflows/test.yaml` from `main_RENAME_THIS_TO_ENABLE_TEST` to `main`. Commit and push. The action will start running in the Actions tab in the repository site.
